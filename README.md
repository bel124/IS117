#Tutorial:


Welcome to my tutorial!
Today I will be giving a quick but very useful detailed
 tutorial to understand the usage of GitHub. 
 Github is a software development platform where users can
 safely save their projects and work remotely. It uses a command line tool
 known as git to perform certain tasks to be published onto 
 certain repositories. A repository is like a folder where users
 can store all their files and work in process. In order to have
 files transferred from a user's local machine to one of their
 designated repositories on GitHub, one must clone that repository
 into the local machine through the command line --> typing:
 git clone and the repository's url. A user could be working on a large
 project and could be doing certain changes once in a while. A great tool
 GitHub has is the commit command. By committing every time there is
 a change in the project, the user is able to save those changes and 
 track them. Very convenient when the project is left aside for a long
 period of time. One can go back and check what the progress was and
 stay on track and continue with the progress. Once there is a commitment to
 such changes, in order for those changes to be recorded and transferred
 onto the repository, one must push that commitment. The push command 
 allows those changes in the commitment to be applied and keep the
 repository up-to-date. Those changes would be shown online. Github also
 has another useful command known as the pull request. The pull request
 allows users to notify others about the changes made to a branch in a 
 repository. Very useful when a project is being worked on by several 
 individuals. This will allow everyone to be on the same page and updated
 of any and every change made to a project. Branches are use to isolate
 different types of development work without affecting any others. For instance,
 a user could have a branch for school and one for an internship. This
 individual might have very similar work to accomplish but does not want to
 combined them nor confuse them and so uses different branches to which
 certain work has to be applied to each. When an individual does want to
 combine certain branches together, the merge command is very useful
 in order to do so. Merging means combining, so work from both branches become
 one. Merging conflicts can also occur specially when competing line changes. 
 For instance, this happens when two people are trying to make different changes to
 the same lines in the same file but in different branches. In order to do so, one must
 rebase those branches and merge them again. If a user wanted to download commits, files, or
 any references from their remote repository, a useful command to use
 is fetch. Very useful when wanting to see what everyone else has been contributing
 to such project and/or files. 
 I hope this simple tutorial has provided a general idea to those who
 are new to using GitHub.
