Welcome to my tutorial!
Today I will be giving a quick but very useful detailed
 tutorial to understand the usage of GitHub. 
 Github is a software development platform where users can
 safely save their projects and work remotely. It uses a command line tool
 known as git to perform certain tasks to be published onto 
 certain repositories. A repository is like a folder where users
 can store all their files and work in process. In order to have
 files transferred from a user's local machine to one of their
 designated repositories on GitHub, one must clone that repository.
